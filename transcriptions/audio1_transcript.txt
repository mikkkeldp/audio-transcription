I worked there for nearly 6 years in charge of under trafficking, programming and labor migrations. But before the IU-NHC visa, I worked for the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That's right after I returned back from Hong Kong for 3 years with UNHCR. And then back in Hong Kong, I was 8 years living in Hong Kong from the year of 2007. And then in January 2008, I moved to Indonesia. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:32
And you said you worked for an NGO before? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:35
I worked in Hong Kong for a regional NGO called Asian Migrant Center. That's exactly during the year of 2000 to 2007 when I'm here. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:47
And what did that organization do? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:49
Asian Migrant Center is basically a regional NGO, just somehow based in Hong Kong. We do a lot of advocacy policy and we also conduct research. We publish Asian Migrant Yearbook. And then we do a lot of capacity building programming for the NGOs. But somehow my responsibility at that time was actually in charge of the domestic workers programming. So I'm doing a lot of work in Hong Kong, like 50% of my time to do work in Hong Kong. But another 50% is I'm doing work in Taiwan. And then Singapore and also in Indonesia. Some part Malaysia and South Korea too. So you have a collaboration with the NGOs partner in the country where I'm visiting. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:36
So you have a good understanding both from a local level from the NGO and also international level. Regional partner. So one of the questions I had and if you know, I wanted to try to get a sense of when did the migration start for domestic workers from Indonesia? I know it may probably have started in the early 2000s.
